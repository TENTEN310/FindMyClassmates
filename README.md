# Find My Classmates App (Team 10)

## Overview

Find My Classmates allows students to have a verified and accessible application to aid them in building their class schedule. While there are similar websites available, there is no application, and many of the reviews are not verified, resulting in skewed and inaccurate ratings. With this app, we will be able to provide verified and up-to-date information, getting rid of duplicate professors, inaccurate class descriptions, and other confusing information. Find My Classmates will streamline the process and allow students to connect with others before the classes even start, allowing them to settle in and get comfortable with school, especially if you are a first-year student. 

## Features

- **Classmate Roster:** Use our real-time database to help students find their classmates and connect with them using our messaging functionality 
- **Course Info:** We have over 30 courses spanning different departments on our app. Students will be able to find detailed information about their classes there
- **Course Material:** Users are allowed to upload related course work in all types of files to our database so other students can be updated with the most relevant information
- **User Profil:** A page that shows you all the courses you followed and easy access to all of them
