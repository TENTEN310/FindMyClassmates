# Find My Classmates App (Team 10)

## Overview

Find My Classmates allows students to have a verified and accessible application to aid them in building their class schedule. While there are similar websites available, there is no mobile application that is convenient and easy to use. Most of the reviews on these websites are not verified, resulting in skewed and inaccurate ratings. With this app, we will be able to provide verified and up-to-date information, getting rid of duplicate professors, inaccurate class descriptions, and other confusing information. Find My Classmates will streamline the process and allow students to connect with others before the classes even start, allowing them to settle in and get comfortable with school, especially if they are first-year students. 

## Features

- **Classmate Roster:** Uses our real-time database to help students find their classmates and connect with them through our messaging functionality 
- **Course Info:** We have over 30 courses spanning different departments on our app, where students will be able to find detailed information about their classes
- **Course Material:** Users are allowed to upload related course work in all types of files to our database so other students can be updated with the most relevant information
- **User Profile:** Shows you your information along with all the courses you have added to your class roster and provides easy access to every one of them

- **Posting:** Students can post their thoughts about school on our app, helping students familiarize themselves with each other and the school itself
